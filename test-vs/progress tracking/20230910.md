# Progress tracking Friday, 8th September 2023

1. Removing `state` since it may unrellevant in some country.
2. Making Gender data cleansing. Disclaimer: In my country, only 2 genders are aknowledged. 
3. I removed Country since I can't interfere things with country right now. 
4. I found my first scatter which is kind of interesting to be look at. 

### Problem & Obstacles
1. My first model may be overfit (?) I guess talking with the professor will solve the problem by Monday
2. I believe this is not the end of this research. I still have to search other data to minimize relevancies.
