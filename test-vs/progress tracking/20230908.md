# Progress tracking Friday, 8th September 2023

Today my target to cluster the value out are not done due to uncleaned and unformatted data. 

1. Created KMeansFactory
2. Tiding up the source code by grouping the file by its responsibilities
> ### `src/main` folder
> This folder mainly used for the source code.
> 
> ### `src/resources` folder
> This folder mainly used for the raw dataset or output of anything needed by the logic
>
> ### `src/test` folder
> This folder mainly used for test source code.

3. Change file naming convention into `snake_case` (was `kebab-case`) except for a file that contains class only, it uses `PascalCase`.
4. Installed `scikit-learn` ; `matplotlib` ; `pandas` 

### Problem & Obstacles
I currently dealing problem with Python Programming since I'm still not used to it. Also I'm kind of clueless to the dataset cleansing techniques. 
Hopefully I can find something by Monday to be reported. 

I should learn Data Cleansing and done it in this dataset by tommorow.
